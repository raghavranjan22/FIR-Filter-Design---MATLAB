# FIR-Filter-Design---MATLAB

This MATLAB script visualizes and compares the frequency-domain characteristics  of four commonly used window functions in Digital Signal Processing (DSP):
1.Rectangular Window
2.Hanning Window
3.Hamming Window
4.Blackman Window

The program computes and plots both the magnitude spectrum (in dB) and phase spectrum for each window function, allowing for easy visual comparison of their performance in spectral analysis and FIR filter design.

Features:-
1.Takes window length N as user input.
2.Computes the Discrete-Time Fourier Transform (DTFT) of each window function.
3.Plots 8 subplots:
4.Magnitude (dB) and Phase for each window type.
Demonstrates how windowing affects main-lobe width and side-lobe attenuation.
